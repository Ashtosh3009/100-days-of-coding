# 100 Days of Coding Challenge

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ I'm embarking on a journey of self-improvement through coding by taking up the **100 Days of Coding Challenge**. Over the next 100 days, I'll be coding every day and sharing my experiences, challenges, and progress with the community.

## Day 5

For the first day of my coding challenge, I've accomplished the following:

- **Count Number of Digits - Mathematical Approach**: Understand how to perform mathematical operations and recursion in Java to count the number of digits in a given number.
- **Compute Nth Fibonacci Number - Recursion and Memoization**: Understand and apply the concepts of recursion and memoization to compute the Nth number in the Fibonacci sequence.
- **Toggle Case of Characters - String Operations**: Understand and implement string manipulation methods in Java to toggle the case of each character in a string.


Feel free to join me on this journey! I'll be updating this README with my daily progress, so stay tuned for more updates. If you have any suggestions, feedback, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out. Let's code together! ðŸš€
