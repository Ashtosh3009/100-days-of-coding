# 100 Days of Coding Challenge

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ I'm embarking on a journey of self-improvement through coding by taking up the **100 Days of Coding Challenge**. Over the next 100 days, I'll be coding every day and sharing my experiences, challenges, and progress with the community.

## Day 3

For the third day of my coding challenge, I've accomplished the following:

- **Make Sidebar Menu On Website**: I created a simple Sidebar Menu using HTML and CSS. You can check out the implementation by following this [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/P1RwfxvQKQM?si=C3T6pp8YNEubFB1b).

Feel free to join me on this journey! I'll be updating this README with my daily progress, so stay tuned for more updates. If you have any suggestions, feedback, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out. Let's code together! ðŸš€
