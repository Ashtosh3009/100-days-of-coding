# 100 Days of Coding Challenge

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ I'm embarking on a journey of self-improvement through coding by taking up the **100 Days of Coding Challenge**. Over the next 100 days, I'll be coding every day and sharing my experiences, challenges, and progress with the community.

## Day 7

For the sixth day of my coding challenge, I've accomplished the following:

- **Counting Capital Letters - String Manipulation**: Understand how to traverse a string and count the number of capital letters in Java.
- **Sum of Largest and Smallest Element in an Array - Array Operations**: Understand how to traverse an array and identify the smallest and largest elements in Java.
- **Recursive Exponentiation**: Understand and implement the recursive method to calculate the power of a number in Java.

Feel free to join me on this journey! I'll be updating this README with my daily progress, so stay tuned for more updates. If you have any suggestions, feedback, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out. Let's code together! ðŸš€
