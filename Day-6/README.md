# 100 Days of Coding Challenge

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ I'm embarking on a journey of self-improvement through coding by taking up the **100 Days of Coding Challenge**. Over the next 100 days, I'll be coding every day and sharing my experiences, challenges, and progress with the community.

## Day 6

For the sixth day of my coding challenge, I've accomplished the following:

- **How To Make Website DARK MODE | Dark Theme Website Design Using HTML, CSS & JS**: [Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/9LZGB3OLXNQ?si=BBwYPFt4unKizppH).
- **How To Make Dark Mode Website Design Part 2 | Dark Theme Website Using HTML CSS JS**: [Video Tutorial](https://youtu.be/2j_kBqpFK-g?si=a7NlkzWcDxw3TscZ).
- **Count Digit Frequency - Number Operations**: Learn to manipulate numbers and count the frequency of a specific digit within a larger number.


Feel free to join me on this journey! I'll be updating this README with my daily progress, so stay tuned for more updates. If you have any suggestions, feedback, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out. Let's code together! ðŸš€
