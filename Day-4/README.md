# 100 Days of Coding Challenge

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ I'm embarking on a journey of self-improvement through coding by taking up the **100 Days of Coding Challenge**. Over the next 100 days, I'll be coding every day and sharing my experiences, challenges, and progress with the community.

## Day 4

For the fourth day of my coding challenge, I've accomplished the following:

- **How To Make A Popup Using HTML, CSS And JavaScript | Create a Modal Box In HTML Website**: [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/AF6vGYIyV8M?si=IRbrJeAtTi31KG4I).
- **Finding the Second Largest Element - Array Operations**: Strengthen understanding of array traversal and conditional statements by implementing a method to find the second largest element in an array.
- **Factorial Computation - Recursion**: Understand the concept of recursion and how it can be used to solve problems that involve repeated application of a function, such as calculating the factorial of a number.
- **Remove Spaces from a String - String Manipulation**: Understand and practice the manipulation of strings in Java by implementing a function to remove all spaces from a given string.


Feel free to join me on this journey! I'll be updating this README with my daily progress, so stay tuned for more updates. If you have any suggestions, feedback, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out. Let's code together! ðŸš€
