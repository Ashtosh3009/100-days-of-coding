# 100 Days of Coding Challenge

Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹ I'm embarking on a journey of self-improvement through coding by taking up the **100 Days of Coding Challenge**. Over the next 100 days, I'll be coding every day and sharing my experiences, challenges, and progress with the community.

## Day 4

For the fourth day of my coding challenge, I've accomplished the following:

- **How To Make A Popup Using HTML, CSS And JavaScript | Create a Modal Box In HTML Website**: [video tutorial](https://youtu.be/AF6vGYIyV8M?si=IRbrJeAtTi31KG4I).


Feel free to join me on this journey! I'll be updating this README with my daily progress, so stay tuned for more updates. If you have any suggestions, feedback, or just want to say hi, feel free to reach out. Let's code together! ðŸš€
